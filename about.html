                        <h3>EACH FOR ALL!</h3>
                        <p>Hello!<br>This is Rithika and Srija pursuing Computer Science degree at Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology,Hyderabad. We are currently in our 3rd year of engineering. </p>
                        <p>This project is based on the idea of allocating scarce resources to schools from other schools which are available with them in a particular time slot, so that all the resources that are required for students’ growth are equally distributed among all schools.
                        </p>
                        <p><ul><li>Resource allocation systems manage a fixed amount of some given resources,such as playgrounds,library etc that must be allocated to users who request them.</li><br>
                           <li>Mainly Schools from the rural backgrounds gets benefitted from this project,as they might not be having all the resources.<br></li><br>
                            <li>We are following the idea  ‘Each Resource For All’ which makes this project useful for schools and students growth. </li>
                            </ul>
